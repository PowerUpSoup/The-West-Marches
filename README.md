The West Marches (a dnd companion app) https://the-west-marches-client.now.sh/

A "The West Marches" style Dungeons and Dragons game involves a setting with a map. The players make their camp at a town on the map, and decide what kind of adventure they want to have, and who will go on the adventure before the dungeon master even gets involved. This takes the burden of organizing games from the dungeon master so he can focus on writing and running the adventure. This app helps by allowing the dungeon master to invite players to his game, where the players can suggest adventures on the noticeboard, and decide which adventure they're most interested in.
